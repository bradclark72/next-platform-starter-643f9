# **App Name**: Dinner Spinner

## Core Features:

- Restaurant List Input: Allow users to input a list of restaurants they want to choose from.
- Random Selection: Select a random restaurant from the inputted list when the button is clicked.
- Restaurant Details Lookup (AI tool): If the restaurant selection button is pressed a second time within 5 minutes, fetch additional details about the currently-selected restaurant, such as address, cuisine type, customer rating, and a recent review. Display those details below the name. The LLM will use its best judgment as to whether the displayed info matches the restaurant the user originally had in mind.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft coral (#F08080) to evoke a sense of warmth and invitation, reflecting a pleasant dining experience.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), providing a neutral and calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted olive green (#808000), adding an earthy tone that complements the coral and beige.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif font for an elegant, intellectual and contemporary feel, appropriate for both headlines and body.
- Use simple, line-based icons related to dining (cutlery, plates, location pin) for clear navigation and visual appeal.
- Clean and intuitive layout with the input field at the top, a prominent 'Spin' button in the center, and the selected restaurant displayed clearly below.
- Subtle animation for the 'Spin' button press, like a quick rotation or a gentle pulse, to provide feedback to the user.
